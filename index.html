                <h3>Computer Literacy</h3>
                <p>
                    My love for technology came from watching my brothers play video games for hours on end. Then one
                    day
                    when I realized my controller was not plugged in, I asked the question that now haunts my curiosity.
                </p>
                <p class="question">
                    <em>How does this work?</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside me sparked this joy of taking things apart. That then led me to enjoy putting them back
                    together or making something different entirely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For years my role was free IT for the family and I even got to build computers for my high school,
                    friends, and my
                    personal
                    computer. I did my best to uncover their needs and try to create a PC that exists for them rather
                    something you could go find on a shelf.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So many people use a multitude of devices every day, so I believe it's important to understand how
                    they work and to make them more understandable for others.
                </p>

                <h3>Strong Creative Ability</h3>
                <p>
                    As I said above, I really love art in many forms. I try to take into consideration how things will
                    be
                    perceived in different views and emotional states others are in. It's all in the detail and what
                    really sets whatever it
                    is I'm doing apart. Art is what gives us individuality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A great example of my creativity is my journey with music. I am fully self taught with the
                    instruments I play, singing duets with myself, and even the program I use to record, engineer,
                    produce, and / or master in my creative outlet.
